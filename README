# ⛓️ CliffSafe – Secure Token Vesting on Solana

CliffSafe is a decentralized token vesting protocol built on **Solana** using **Anchor**. It enables teams, DAOs, and projects to securely lock and release SPL tokens based on customizable **cliff** or **linear** vesting schedules — all enforced on-chain.

## 🚀 Why CliffSafe?

Many protocols need to distribute tokens over time — for investors, founders, contributors, and partners. Doing this securely and transparently is critical.

**Problems with existing approaches:**
- Manual unlocks with centralized control
- Risk of early token dumping
- Lack of transparency for recipients

**CliffSafe solves this with:**
- Fully on-chain logic
- No trusted intermediaries
- Support for both cliff and linear schedules
- Compatible with any SPL token

## 🔧 Features

- 🔒 **Cliff Vesting**: Tokens unlock 100% after a cliff period
- 📈 **Linear Vesting**: Tokens unlock gradually over time
- ⏱️ **Custom Schedules**: Set start time, duration, cliff period
- 🔁 **Claim Anytime**: Beneficiaries can claim vested tokens when eligible
- 🧱 **SPL Support**: Works with all SPL tokens
- 🔐 **PDA Vaults**: Secure escrow via Anchor’s Program Derived Addresses

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

When a vesting schedule is created:
1. Tokens are sent to a **vault PDA**
2. Vesting metadata is stored in a `VestingAccount`
3. The beneficiary can call `claim()` based on time elapsed
4. Tokens are transferred from the vault to the recipient

### On-Chain Accounts

| Account          | Purpose                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `VestingAccount` | Stores config: type, timing, etc.  |
| `TokenVault`     | PDA holding the locked SPL tokens  |
| `Beneficiary`    | Can claim vested tokens            |
| `TokenMint`      | The SPL token being vested         |
